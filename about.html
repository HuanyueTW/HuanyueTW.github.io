        <font id = "aboutme" style="">
			&emsp;&emsp;My name is Brian Chiang, a senior student in Chang Gung University and major in <br />
			information management.
            There are five people in my family, include my dad, mom,<br />
			brother, sister and me. My parents always believe that learning is not limited to books,<br />
			and this idea stimulates my curiosity of many things and it promotes me to touch different<br />
			fields.<br /><br />
			&emsp;&emsp;After diverse exploration, literary is my favorite field. No matter it's writing or<br />
			reading the book, they are all the things I'm willing to try. Because of participating such<br />
			kinds of activities, I can be either active or quiet. <br /><br />
			&emsp;&emsp;I feel so happy about the life in university, not only I can choose subjects I interested in,<br />
            but also there are lots of friends I can have heart to heart talk and play with each other.<br />
            Looking forward that I can have my own expertise before graduating from CGU and<br />
            finish my graduate school in the National Chengchi University Or Taiwan University of<br />
			Science and Technology later! :)
